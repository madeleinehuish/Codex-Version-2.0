This is an ES6 upgrade of my quarter 4 final capstone project, built in React.js and Node.js. I am cleaning it up to keep current with modern practices in React.js. It works in sync with an Atom plugin. It is still a work in progress and I hope to add Slack functionality, build out the file system, and much more. I might possibly build version 3 as an Electron app.
